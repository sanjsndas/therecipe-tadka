                <p>
                    We have implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect your personal information from accidental loss, unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. These measures include:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Using SSL/TLS encryption for data transmission over the internet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Limiting access to personal information to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to access it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> Conducting periodic reviews of our security practices to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> Collecting only the personal information that is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Employee Training:</strong> Training our employees on data protection best practices and their responsibilities in handling personal information.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While we strive to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You are responsible for keeping your password and account details confidential. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (e.g., if you feel that the security of your account has been compromised), please immediately notify us.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-curry-leaf-green mt-10 mb-4">6. Children's Privacy</h4>
                <p>
                    Our Site is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@recipetadka.com" class="text-sizzling-orange hover:underline">privacy@recipetadka.com</a>.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-curry-leaf-green mt-10 mb-4">7. International Data Transfers</h4>
                <p>
                    The RecipeTadka is based in the United States. If you are accessing our Site from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those in your country of residence. By using our Site, you consent to the transfer of your information to the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When transferring data from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, we implement appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, to ensure your personal information is protected. For more information on these safeguards, please contact us.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-curry-leaf-green mt-10 mb-4">8. Data Retention</h4>
                <p>
                    We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if you have an account with us, we will retain your account information for as long as your account is active. If you unsubscribe from our newsletter, we will retain your email address on a suppression list to ensure we do not send you further marketing communications. User-generated content may be retained even after account deletion, particularly if it is part of a public forum or has been integrated into other aspects of the Site.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-curry-leaf-green mt-10 mb-4">9. Third-Party Websites and Services</h4>
                <p>
                    Our Site may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by The RecipeTadka.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any third-party websites or services you visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if you click on an advertisement on our Site, you may be directed to a third-party website. These third parties may collect information about you independently. Similarly, if you share content from our Site on social media platforms, those platforms will have their own privacy policies governing the data they collect.
                </p>
